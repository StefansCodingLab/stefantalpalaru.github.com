						   <h1>CATIA Macro Development During Internship</h1>
			<p>During my internship, I developed a CATIA macro using Visual Basic and CATIA Script to streamline the process of searching and renaming items within a CATIA tree structure. The macro I created allows users to efficiently locate all instances of specified items and rename them according to predefined criteria, significantly enhancing productivity and accuracy.</p>
			
			<h2>Key Features and Benefits:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Automated Search and Rename:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Traverses the entire tree structure within a CATIA document.</li>
						<li>Identifies items based on user-defined search parameters.</li>
						<li>Applies specified renaming conventions to ensure consistency and reduce human error.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Improved Search Times:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Developed to handle assemblies with thousands of parts.</li>
						<li>Facilitates easier navigation through complex documents.</li>
						<li>Significantly reduces the time required to locate and rename items manually.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Allows users to input search terms and renaming rules easily.</li>
						<li>Designed with an intuitive interface to enhance user experience.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Implemented mechanisms to manage unexpected inputs.</li>
						<li>Ensures reliability and robustness of the macro.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Additional Contributions:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Axis Systems and Reference Elements Macro:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Assisted a colleague in creating a macro for inserting and automatically defining axis systems and custom reference elements.</li>
						<li>Enhanced the automation capabilities within our CATIA environment.</li>
						<li>Allowed for more efficient and accurate placement of reference elements crucial for various design processes.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Both of these initiatives—the search and rename macro and the axis system insertion macro—have proven to be valuable tools, automating repetitive tasks, saving time, and significantly improving the efficiency of searching through large assemblies and defining essential reference elements. The resulting enhancement in search times and accuracy has greatly benefited the design process within the organization.</p>

                <h3>Languages: Fluent English (C1), Intermediate Russian and French (B1)</h3>
			<h1>Language Proficiency</h1>
			<p>I became proficient in English through a combination of immersive experiences and practical applications. Regular communication with British and American natives helped refine my conversational skills and understanding of different accents and dialects. Completing paperwork and managing documentation for my game design server enhanced my written English, ensuring clarity and precision. Additionally, my Erasmus program exchange in Edinburgh, Scotland, provided a rich cultural and academic environment where I further honed my language skills through daily interactions and academic coursework. These experiences collectively contributed to my strong command of the English language, both spoken and written.</p>
			<p>Beyond English, I have also taken individual courses in French and Russian. These courses have given me a solid foundation in both languages, which I believe will be beneficial for my career by opening up opportunities to work in diverse international environments and engage with a broader range of clients and collaborators.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Design and Analysis</h3>
            <h1>Proficiency in Design Engineering and Analysis</h1>
			<p>My proficiency in design engineering and analysis stems from a rich blend of academic learning, hands-on projects, and professional experiences. During my time at university, I was deeply involved in several impactful projects, such as designing a Paralympics bike that could be controlled solely by hands and developing an automated vehicle using AVL Boost and MATLAB Simulink. These projects honed my skills in applying theoretical concepts to practical challenges, particularly in ensuring safety and functionality in complex systems.</p>
			<p>My expertise with CAD software, including CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, and NX, was developed through rigorous academic coursework and numerous design projects. I became adept at creating precise 3D models, performing simulations, and generating detailed technical drawings. These skills were further enhanced during my internships, where I developed CATIA macros to automate repetitive tasks and collaborated on creating axis systems and custom reference elements, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy in design workflows.</p>
			<p>In addition to CAD software, I have substantial experience with MATLAB and C++. My work with MATLAB Simulink in university involved developing small engineering applications and performing dynamic system simulations, which enhanced my analytical capabilities. My individual projects, including scripting for a game server, allowed me to apply C++ to real-world scenarios, managing a 30+ daily player base and ensuring robust system performance. These programming experiences have complemented my engineering skills, enabling me to develop and debug complex systems efficiently.</p>
			<p>Through these diverse experiences, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of design engineering and analysis, equipping me with the tools and knowledge to tackle complex engineering challenges and drive innovation in my field.</p>

            <h3>Electronics and Microcontrollers (Arduino)</h3>
		   <p>During my studies at Heriot-Watt University in Scotland, I undertook a design project to build a small robotic car using an Arduino microcontroller and C++ programming. The robot was designed to detect nearby obstacles and inform the user of its next course of action.</p>

			<h2>Key Features and Achievements:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Microcontroller:</strong> Utilized Arduino for controlling the robotic car.</li>
				<li><strong>Programming:</strong> Implemented C++ to program the robot's functionalities.</li>
				<li><strong>Obstacle Detection:</strong> Integrated sensors to detect obstacles in the robot's path.</li>
				<li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Developed a system to inform the user of the robot's decisions.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>This project enhanced my skills in microcontroller programming and real-time system design, providing valuable hands-on experience in robotics and embedded systems.</p>
